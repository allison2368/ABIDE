## This is a respository for the source code for my undergraduate research topic of Autism and behavioral analysis. All code is under the format of Jupyter Notebook

## This is where I will track the information I learned about k-nearest neighbors and the steps that I took 

### K-nearest Neighbors (KNN): it is a non-parametric supervised learning classifier. It uses proximity to classify new data points into groups. 
### Instance-based learning (compared to model-based models): instance-based models learn from examples, and make predictions by finding similar examples in the training data, while model-based models learn the underlying relationships and patterns in the data by creating a mathematical representation.
### As the dataset becomes increasingly complex, the model doesn't perform as well
### Pick an odd k number to avoid ties 
### Works well to impute data when we have missing data points.
